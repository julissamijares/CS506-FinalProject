# CS506-FinalProject


### 1. The Influence of Climate Change on Migration Patterns

**Description of the project:**  
Investigate how climate change is affecting migration patterns globally, focusing on regions most impacted by environmental changes.

**Goals:**  
- Analyze trends in migration due to climate-related factors (e.g., rising sea levels, extreme weather).
- Understand the socioeconomic implications of climate-induced migration on host regions.

**Data Collection:**  
- Use datasets from the [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)](https://www.unhcr.org/) and [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/) on migration and climate data.
- Access climate data from sources like the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](https://www.noaa.gov/) or [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/).

**Modeling:**  
- Employ clustering techniques to categorize regions based on migration trends and climate vulnerability.
- Use regression models to explore the relationship between specific climate indicators and migration rates.

**Visualization:**  
- Create maps to visualize migration flows and climate vulnerability hotspots.
- Use interactive dashboards to showcase trends over time.

**Test Plan:**  
- Hold out 20% of data for testing.
- Validate findings by comparing historical data with recent trends.
